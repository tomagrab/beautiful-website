# Creating a Beautiful Website

I have been learning about web development for about 8-9 months now and I decided to start working on
projects without any guidance to:

1. Practice web development
2. Build a portfolio
3. Maybe use them as templates in the future, if they are good enough

This is the first of those projects. The biggest weakness I have had thoughout
my web development journey has been web design - I am no artist by any stretch of the word.
My goal for this project is to make a website that is very pleasing to the eye.

As of 17:59, 06/23/2020, without having written any code these are the resources
I plan on using for this project:

## Frontend

**Languages**

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Vanilla JS

**Frameworks**

- Bootstrap 4
- jQuery

**Misc**

- Google Fonts

## Backend

- NodeJS
- NPM

## Updates

For some inspiration on colors to use,
I visited this website: https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/ and chose to go with the
"#10 Contemporary and Bold" theme.

**I will be referring to the "Hello, world!"
box as "title" in the following section -
not to be confused with "Title" in the
navbar.**

I got the idea to use some CSS animations
on the homepage where the page title slides
up into place as it fades in. My initial
thoughts were to use vanilla JavaScript,
but I quickly found that I am not skilled enough
in JS to do so. My knee-jerk reaction then
was to use jQuery, but I want to strictly
avoid using jQuery in order to challenge myself.

The CSS animations as they stand do not
satisfy what I am trying to accomplish -
I want the title to slide up, then have the
two boxes below it slide/fade into place
after the title reaches its destination.

I could easily do this using jQuery,
but this project is not meant to be an easy
one - in fact, it is meant to be the exact opposite.
