# Creating a Beautiful Website

I have been learning about web development for about 8-9 months now and I decided to start working on
projects without any guidance to:

1. Practice web development
2. Build a portfolio
3. Maybe use them as templates in the future, if they are good enough

This is the first of those projects. The biggest weakness I have had thoughout
my web development journey has been web design - I am no artist by any stretch of the word.
My goal for this project is to make a website that is very pleasing to the eye.

As of 17:59, 06/23/2020, without having written any code these are the resources
I plan on using for this project:

## Frontend

**Languages**

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Vanilla JS
- jQuery

**Frameworks**

- Bootstrap 4

**Misc**

- Google Fonts

## Backend

- NodeJS
- NPM
